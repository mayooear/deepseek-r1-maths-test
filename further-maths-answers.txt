DEEPSEEK R1 SOLUTIONS:
1. (a) x = 1
   The intersection is the line z = 1 + 2y. Sketch a straight line in the y-z plane with slope 2 and z-intercept 1.

   (b) y = 1
   The intersection is the parabola z = x^2 + 2. Sketch an upward-opening parabola with vertex at (0, 2).

3. (a) Cross product a × b = 2i + 6j -11k. Solving gives p = 7, q = 4.

   (b)(i) Volume equation |2d + 6e -11f| = 42. Relationships: 2d + 6e -11f = ±42.

   (ii) These represent two parallel planes where point C must lie for volume 7.

4. Using reduction formula for I_n:
   A_n = (n+1)/(n+2). Sequence increases since A_{n+1} - A_n > 0. Limit A = 1.
